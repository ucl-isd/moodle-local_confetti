A simple plugin that throws virtual confetti throughout Moodle when a DOM element with one of the given class names is clicked.
Trigger class names can be defined in the settings.
This was inspired by a DevJam project at MoodleMootDACH 2025 in LÃ¼beck but created from scratch.

Most code was created by ChatGPT after given detailed instructions.
It particularly had problems applying the hook API correctly so human intervention was required, as well for cleaning up PHPCS issues.
